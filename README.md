# Simple demo of overfitting

The point of this demo was to just have fun with python in WebAssembly :)
To run locally, install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), and run `uv run marimo edit Test.py`

To view the notebook, go to github pages (link)[https://anstadnik.github.io/FV_demo/]. Pls use the laptop, as it might crash on mobile (it runs experiment on wasm, I assume it requires a bit more compute).
